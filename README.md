# Cricket-Data-Anlaysis

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of cricket data using statistical techniques and data visualization tools. The analysis covered various aspects of the game, including player performance, match outcomes. By leveraging tools like Python, Pandas, and PowerBI, I was able to uncover key insights, such as top-performing players, winning patterns. The project also involved the use of advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques to present findings in an easily interpretable manner, aiding in strategic decision-making.
